We really lucked out because it fell out of escrow and we pounced on it! And it\'s been a really awesome creative journey ever since. I\'ve learned a lot about my style through decorating this home. I mean, who gets 2,100 sq. ft. of canvas to play with? It\'s gone through many changes as any house of my always does. I wish I could transport it all the way to LA, but where\'s the fun in that? I love a new start, which means I\'m not taking much back with me except some artworks and pillows.\r\n\r\nSince I\'ve never given it a proper home tour, here goes! This will still be our home so it isn\'t a farewell! We love this house so much. We have so many fun memories of being first-time home owners. I still remember our first year when there was a winter freeze and we had to crawl under the house at night to wrap up all the exposed pipes. I was seriously, like, WTF? I didn\'t think NOLA could get that cold. And apparently, the heartmate saw an animal carcass down there. Yuck! Or that one time when I hired someone to pressure wash the house and they started washing the soffit vents and sprayed water into our attic. I had to crawl up there and remove all the wet pink insulation. A day later, I had an allergic reaction from the fiberglass insulation which looked like bites all over my arms and body. I freaked the F out because I thought I had scabies or something. It was real fun!\r\n\r\nAnywho, . I can\'t wait to share our next home with y\'all!','2018-02-15 17:22:54','Crazy Colorful Home Tour',2,'Our-Crazy-Colorful-New-Orleans-Home-Tour',1),(2,'MY VERY BEST TIPS AND TRICKS TO STYLING A BEAUTIFUL ROOM','While there are many aspects of my role as an interior designer that I adore to my core, styling a room has quickly become one of my favourite tasks. Whether it’s setting everything up just so for a final client reveal, shooting a space for my portfolio, or getting a shot that’s just right for Instagram, I truly enjoy every last moment. After 11 years in the design industry, and almost 8 in the blog world, I’ve definitely picked up a few secrets along the way. Following is how to style a room so it really and truly shines.\r\n\r\nSOMETHING SOFT & TEXTURED IN EVERY SHOT\r\nWhether it’s a bathroom with a turkish towel casually draped across the tub, or a woven basket overflowing with blankets, adding a little fabric in one way or another is a must. It instantly adds a warm and cozy factor, not to mention makes a room feel lived in, which really helps draw the viewer in.\r\n\r\nUNEVEN GROUPINGS\r\nWhen styling bookshelves, coffee tables, or kitchen and bathroom counters I always try to arrange things in groups of three or five. There’s just something about the odd-numbered groupings that is far more pleasing to the eye than those of the even-numbered variety.\r\n\r\nGREENERY, ALWAYS\r\nA hint of greenery, whether it’s in the form of a 6′ potted plant or a single blade of glass in a clear glass vase, is the quickest way to add life to both a room and photo. The difference with and without plant life is astounding. \r\n\r\nOPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS\r\nThis is a newer trick I realized during one of my shoots with Style at Home, and now that I’ve picked it up I’m noticing it done far and wide. It, of course, pertains more to getting that picture perfect shot than anything else. But not only does opening a door or a window let natural light flood in, but it also makes that final shot feel significantly more welcoming.\r\n\r\nBOOKS, BOOKS, & MORE BOOKS\r\nWhen in doubt, just add books. Stack them under a vase for additional height, layer them on a coffee table for a welcoming feel, and load up on them on bookshelves (because, duh) to fill in the gaps. Books are your very best friend, and I always travel with an Ikea bag full of them at every shoot I attend.

Or you live in the city, but prefer the jungle? Or perhaps you just have a serious love of the outdoors.  Whatever it is that attracts us to the effect of fresh greens in our wallpaper, it seems we can all agree on one thing – we can’t get enough of it! Myself included.\r\n\r\nSo I  decided it was high time we did a major leaf print wallpaper roundup around here. From tropical favorites like banana leaves and palms, to delicate vines and lush foliage, we’ve provided you with all our favorites for your wallpapering delight.\r\n\r\nWith English Country style making a comeback, I think we’ll see a resurgence of these more delicate wallpapers coming up soon! While they may be on the sweet and charming side, they can easily be freshened up with some modern decor, so don’t be afraid to consider them for pretty much any room in the house!\r\n\r\nThe banana leaf needs no introduction. Martinique – the most popular of them all – has been used so many times I’m almost sick of it. But it’s such a classic! Similar to the palm prints, there are a lot of banana leaf prints that look the same, but have subtle differences in coloring and details that make them unique. Which one are you partial to?\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for drama, you’ll find it here in the section I’m dubbing the ‘jungle’. Dark and lush, I’d love to see one of these in a master bedroom! The most subtle ‘Amorina’ might be my favorite because it truly feels like foliage at night – when you can just barely make out the shape of each leaf.','2018-02-19 12:20:54','Leaf Print Wallpapers',1,'Our-Favorite-Leaf-Print-Wallpapers-',1),(4,'New Year New Home','I hope everyone had a fabulous time ringing in the New Year! We\'ve been busy settling into our new home in LA. I had my family over on Christmas and then we had a friend from New Orleans stay with us over NYE so we scrambled to get the house somewhat presentable and habitable for guests. And now I wanna give you all a glimpse of our new abode! It\'s nestled in the El Sereno hills, which is east of LA and borders Alhambra, South Pasadena, and Highland Park. It\'s literally less than ten minutes away from my mom and also from my bff, Han, so it\'s perfect! \r\n\r\nIt\'s a four bedroom home built in the 1950s. I know that sounds like a mansion but it\'s only about 1,300 square feet, which means all the rooms are divided into small, cozy spaces. It\'s been flipped by the sellers so the kitchen and bathrooms are new. That being said, the craftsmanship is not quite up to par. Meaning...they did a pretty bad job so we get a chance to Dabify it! I see new tiles, paint, windows, and some custom built-ins in the near future. Yaaas!\r\n\r\n\r\n','2018-02-19 22:08:26','New Year New Home',3,'New-Year-New-Home',4),(8,'One Room Challenge','We are so close to the finish line for the One Room Challenge! Remember how indecisive I was about the paint color? Well, guess what? I decided to do an accent wall. If we can have accent walls inside, why not outside, am I right? I think it would\'ve been too green if we painted the other side. And it\'s just paint after all. We can always go back to black!\r\n\r\nSofas from The Mine arrived! They were really easy to assemble. It\'s already looking cozy AF! We also found 9ft white birds for $50! That\'s just unheard of. Now, all we have left to do is buy more plants, cover the grass area with white rocks, hang string lights, and style the shizzle out of this backyard space. Be sure to come back next week for the full reveal!

When I moved into my last place in Montreal, I thought 515 sq. ft. was as small as it was going to get. I was wrong. Everyone knows that moving to New York is expensive—but one can never really fathom how much you’re faced with signing a lease on an apartment that’s less than half the size and more than three times the price of your old rent. But as cheesy as it sounds, I wouldn’t have traded this tiny space for the world.\r\n\r\nOn moving day, I sat in my empty 280 sq. ft. apartment wondering if I had lost my mind to move into a space so insanely small—but there was one thing I knew for sure—I wanted to be here. And as things kept trickling in as the movers unloaded the truck, one thing became immediately apparent: I owned way too much stuff.\r\n\r\nIt took a while to make this place my own. Between long hours at the office and a complete feeling of hopelessness in front of the accumulating clutter in my tiny space (not to mention the overwhelming amount of better things to do in the city that never sleeps), I put off decorating my New York apartment for much too long.\r\n\r\nI read Marie Kondo’s Spark Joy (and subsequently threw out/donated a ton of stuff I didn’t need), I spent countless hours looking for the perfect sofa (which I eventually found in the Commune collection for West Elm), and put off installing blinds for way too long—especially considering The Shade Store made it the easiest process ever and, in turn, the best decision I made in the space. Around Thanksgiving, my apartment was finally in a place where I was 100% comfortable to come home without feeling like I needed to decorate, hang art, or declutter.','2018-02-24 19:41:01','NEW YORK APARTMENT',4,'INSIDE-MY-FIRST-NEW-YORK-APARTMENT',6),(10,'CLIENT REVEAL: A CLASSIC WASHROOM RENOVATION FOR LLPROJECTVICTOR','It’s always bittersweet when a project comes to a close, and things rings particularly true for this one.

In the same token, however, I’m sure they’re thrilled to no end to have their bathroom (and lives!) back. Because no matter how big, or small, a project, the construction portion can be tiresome. That said, when the results are exactly as you had imagined, it feels pretty darn good.\r\n\r\nIf you missed the first post about this classic washroom renovation, I recommend you go check it out (here!) as it gives a lot more of the background details.

But my friend Jess? Well she’s a master at ALL of the things. For real – all of them. The woman is incredible, and I’m certain that everything she touches turns to gold.  \r\n\r\nWe actually worked closely together years ago at SMP Living, and I’ve had the pleasure of seeing her in action first hand time and time again. So when she picked up this super inexpensive Ikea desk for her studio, and then proceeded to wrap it in linen to bring it to next-level status, I was equally impressed (per usual), as I was jealous of her creativity (per usual – ha!). The results look rich and luxurious, and you’d never know it’s an Ikea desk hack – which is exactly what you want from an Ikea desk hack (am I right!?)

Though they were unfinished, their rough and tumbleness began to grow on me. When operation get-bedroom-finished came into full swing not long ago, I decided they could stick around (dang budget) but they needed to step it up. Enter: stain. After two quick coats (and three days of air drying on the balcony), I brought them in and couldn’t believe the immediate difference. The result feels rustic and well-loved, bringing about an immediate sense of warmth.

Whether you’re in the middle of a renovation, or simply daydreaming about herringbone tile and new countertops at this point in your life, today I wanted to talk about a few of those design details that shouldn’t be overlooked. And honestly, if you do nothing else, you’d be surprised at how making the following small changes can instantly transform your space. \r\n\r\nREALLY GOOD DOOR HARDWARE\r\nFrom your knobs to your hinges, this is one area that should truly never be overlooked. We were lucky wherein our home boasts mostly original porcelain knobs from 1898, which is it’s own kind of wonderful. However, they most definitely aren’t located throughout. We recently switched out some of the more “builder basic” knobs that graced some our doors on our first floor for these Brookshire knobs from Schlage, and love that the Georgian rosette adds another layer of detail to our home. It has made more of an impact than even I realized, and is a happy sight each day. \r\n\r\nCURTAINS HUNG PROPERLY\r\nI’m going to let you in on a little secret: curtains should be hung as high, and as wide, as your room allows. It is the quickest way to make your space, and windows, feel bigger and brighter, and is an absolute game changer the moment they’re hung. If space allows, you want to have at least 8″ of rod and curtain past your window casing, and they should be mounted as high as your ceilings (and crown molding) allows. You can have them puddle on the floor for a more relaxed feel, or opt for ones that just barely graze the floor for a more tailored appeal. \r\n\r\nGREAT LIGHTING\r\nI’ve mentioned my love for really good lighting a number of times over the years, but this time I’m talking more about your light bulbs and less about your fixtures. Lighting is one of those things that should never be overlooked, and nothing ruins a space more than overly yellow, or overly blue bulbs. Lately I’ve been using GE reveal bulbs in all of my client projects, and it’s amazing how much of a difference it makes. It is the closest thing to natural light on the market right now, and bathes each room in a soft, warm, glow. \r\n\r\nYELLOWED OUTLETS\r\nWhen we first moved into our home, one of the very first things we tackled was our outlets and light switches. Switching out those old, cracked, yellowed covers for those that are light, bright, and clean, truly made all the difference in the world. \r\n\r\nAREA RUGS\r\nI’ve been in the Interior Design industry for over a decade now, and have been involved in more furniture installs than I can count. Each and every time, without question, the moment an area rug goes down is the very instant that a house feels like a home. Not only does it help ground and define each space (crucial in the mostly-open-concept homes we have today), but that layer adds an element of cozy and comfortability that isn’t easily achieved in any other way. I’m telling ya, it’s a design game changer.

Design, my friends, is in the details. Everything from the finish of your curtain rings to the scent of that candle on your table makes a difference. And while individually they may not matter, together they add up to make the whole of your space. So if this sort of thing is important to you, stay tuned, because I’ve partnered with Urban Barn to divulge my biggest coffee table styling tricks. And, in order to do so, I’ve styled my coffee table three entirely different ways to help show you a few variations so that you, too, can make yours come to life.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, there are typically five main components that I always use to style my client’s coffee tables. A tray to corral all of those loose bits and baubles. A sculpture of some variety for interest. A vase (or two) for height. A series of books. And something green to add a little life. In the case of the “glam” version of my coffee table, I kept the palette on the cool and crisp side, playing with a lot of blue and silvery tones to add that instant luxe factor.  \r\n\r\n','2018-03-02 10:50:01','STYLE YOUR COFFEE TABLE',4,'MY-VERY-BEST-TRICKS-FOR-STYLING-YOUR-COFFEE-TABLE',5),(17,'THE START OF OUR SMART HOME JOURNEY','In light of full discretion, I’ve never much been the tecchy type. Though I’ve since upgraded, I lived happily with an iPhone 4 for longer than I’ll ever admit, and always shied away from anything with too many bells or whistles. Keep it simple was always the name of my game, and while that still rings true in many aspects of my life, I’ve recently realized that transforming our home into a smart home is the simplest answer. Yup. We’ve begun to climb down the rabbit hole and it’s its own kind of glorious.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, I had the chance to take a tour of the Best Buy Smart Home. And while I knew it would be beautiful (it was designed by my incredibly talented friend Christine Dovey, after all) I was legitimately shocked at my reaction. In truth: I was blown away – both by the actual technology that exists out there, and by the fact that none of it took away from any of Christine’s designs.\r\n\r\nFrom a super sleek Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator that could tell you when you were running low on milk, to an integrated Bosch espresso maker that you could control from your phone while laying in bed (#goals), I knew I had opened Pandora’s box, and there was no turning back.\r\n\r\nWhile we’re still a ways away from anything too over the top**, Justin and I have recently started incorporating a few notable smart home changes into our own house.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the wonderful Geek Squad, we recently switched out our ancient thermostat for the Nest. It looks so much better, but, most importantly, the cozy factor has improved big time. Not only has it significantly helped with our hydro bill by tracking our habits and automatically adjusting the temperature when we’re home or away (how does it know!??). But we also have access to everything through the app on our phones. Meaning: we can turn the temperature right up when we wake up in the morning, and linger in bed a little while longer until the house has a chance to warm up. Or, the crazy dog lady within me can turn it up (or down) if I’m out and concerned about Sage’s comfort. Yes, I’ve done that. No, I’m not even ashamed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Nest, we’ve also installed this super simple security camera just outside our front door. I tend to have an overactive imagination (the true crime podcasts I’ve been hooked on as of late don’t help). And it’s something I’ve wanted to do since we moved out of our condo. I love that I can monitor and interact with anyone who comes on our property. When the door rings at a strange hour, I can check on my phone to see whether or not I feel like putting pants on to answer it. I know. I’m living the life here, people. It’s my cozy little cocoon and I wouldn’t change it for a thing.  \r\n','2018-03-02 12:00:00','SMART HOME ',11,'THE-START-OF-OUR-SMART-HOME-JOURNEY',6),(18,'COLOR CODED: HOW TO GO GRAY IN A GOOD WAY!','Here in San Francisco, our dear friend Karl the Fog isn’t shy when it comes to making his appearance this time of year. Just as the months are getting warmer he arrives in full force. It’s a rare thing to look at the horizon and not see an ominous gray blanket slowly creeping through the streets. It’s similar to the way gray hairs are tending to creep out of nowhere on my head – hence, why most people tend to associate the color with BUZZKILL! In spite of all that, we still happen to love the color gray. In fact, as the spaces below illustrate, we’re here to prove goin’ gray has never looked better!\r\n\r\nWe’re obsessed with the moody yet calming look that gray can offer. Whether it be a dark charcoal on walls, soft heather gray on furniture or monochromatic artwork – the spectrum of “gray” is one of the most versatile and inoffensive palettes out there.\r\n\r\nBy layering your gray tones and mixing your textures you can add lusicious depth and interest to any room. The living room above with its variety of gray textiles and black & white artwork feels cozy and inviting rather than cold. A pop of natural wood also helps warm things up. The bathroom above is a great example of that. The wood vanity, divan and wall mirror contrast with the slate tones beautifully. Are you swooning over it as much as we are??\r\n\r\nWhether you apply gray with a light touch or fully commit to the singular color palette, it’s a softer way to play on classic black & white.

I’ve blogged about them here endlessly. I’ve obsessed about the design of our own for nearly two years now – yes we bought our house TWO years ago. Remodel hell is a subject for another post. Or novel. But I digress. Back to the subject at hand –  I appreciate gorgeous kitchen design, regardless of the style. Which is why I had to share this stunning example from the Sunset Magazine Idea House (now open to the public in Oakland!).\r\n\r\nCreated by Bay Area design aficionado, Lauren Geremia this space is an obvious showstopper. The kitchen is anchored by that stunning wallpaper. I love it’s black ground. It certainly is unusual to do wallpaper in a kitchen, but covered in glass it functions like any other backsplash. Combined with the custom oxidized iron hood and grounded with the white marble counters – it’s simultaneously dramatic and timeless. And of course I love the open shelving – I have very similar plans for the final touches in our space.\r\n\r\nAnd the similarities continue. Like I did for our kitchen, Geremia Design selected Thermador appliances for the space. Thermador is the prefect combination of beautiful form and professional-grade function. For example, the Thermador Pro Grand Range thinks about all the details necessary for perfectly cooked meal so we don’t have to. Thermador’s 3-in-1 Star® Burners five-point design allows for more ports and more flame distribution than a round burner, leading to faster time to boil. Score. The burners also have an exclusive ExtraLow® feature that provides the widest variety of temperature control of any simmer system. It cycles on and off to maintain temperatures as low as 100° for simmering delicate sauces or keeping food warm without scorching. That’s already come in handy for me more than once!\r\n\r\nThermador is actually celebrating its 100th Anniversary this year (they actually introduced the first built in wall oven and matching cooktop in 1947) and their incredibly history is another reason that I love having Thermador in our own 100 year+ old house. To celebrate this major milestone, Thermador is holding an amazing Diamonds Are Forever giveaway right now. Through the end of the month you can enter to win daily prizes like a pair of Waterford Crystal champagne flutes or a Thermador Dishwasher!\r\n','2018-03-03 15:34:08','MAKING A KITCHEN',7,'HOW-TO-CREATE-A-STATEMENT-MAKING-KITCHEN',1),(20,'HOW TO HAVE THE BEST LOOKING REFRIGERATOR IN TOWN','It’s a week of reveals around here. Or at least sneak peeks. Today, you’re getting a preview of my kitchen! I’ve teased about its design in the past (here, here and here to be exact), but I couldn’t’ be happier with the final result. One of the keys to creating a dream kitchen is picking the right appliances. There are a ton of choices out there, but I knew I wanted three things: the highest quality, great functionality and gorgeous design. Case in point: my refrigerator.\r\n\r\nDon’t you just love it? Wait – you can’t see it!? That’s because I knew from the get-go that I wanted an integrated refrigerator. That’s when your refrigerator is covered to look like the rest of your cabinetry. Appliance trends tend to come and go and I wanted to ensure our kitchen would be timeless. Mission accomplished (if I do say so myself)\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to amazing appliances there are only a few obvious options out there, but after doing my research I was sold on Thermador. The timing happened to be ideal – Thermador is celebrating their 100th anniversary this year – so they seemed fitting for my 100+ year old house! Thermador intentionally designs their their appliances to function as fully-flush integrated refrigeration that can seamlessly blend into virtually any design, and offer as much or as little refrigeration, freezer and wine preservation you desire.','2018-03-04 18:39:08','BEST LOOKING REFRIGERATOR',7,'HOW-TO-HAVE-THE-BEST-LOOKING-REFRIGERATOR-IN-TOWN',4),(21,'ON THE HUNT FOR: BLACK STEEL DOORS','If you’ve ever remodeled or redesigned a house, you’re going to relate to this post. If you haven’t, consider this a little peek behind the curtain. You go in thinking everything will just run smoothly, that you will be able to find everything you need and get it when you want it. Alas, the world of home design does not work that way my friends. There are a litany of variables, any of which can trip up your entire design process. Perhaps a trade is unavailable (for the next six months!). Perhaps your dream tile is back ordered (for at least six months). Or perhaps you have a vision that is tough to actualize. This is the case for one of my favorite design ideas for our house: steel doors.\r\n\r\nOne of the key design features I want in our house is steel doors separating this room from the rest of the communal space. Steel doors are stately. They add such drama. They don’t block light. They’re black. And added bonus, they’ll tuck away our TV so as my kid has movie nights with friends (many years down the road – have you read my thoughts on kids and tech??) us adults can enjoy the living room with the doors closed.\r\n\r\nThat said, actualizing these doors is easier said than done. It’s very hard to find sources for custom work. While I’ve found many a resource if I want some steel doors for my bathroom (this Apartment Therapy story is a good one), but crafting a set of 11.5 ft door has proved to be exceedingly challenging. But look at all this pics. The vision is just too good. This design element must become a piece of our house.\r\n\r\n','2018-03-05 11:53:08','BLACK STEEL DOORS',4,'ON-THE-HUNT-FOR--BLACK-STEEL-DOORS',7),(22,'THE SECRET TO PICKING THE PERFECT LIGHT FIXTURE','When it comes to finding the perfect light fixture, there are two ways to think about it. You can take a very utilitarian approach, focused solely on wattage or light direction, or you can embrace a flair for the dramatic. I approach lighting like you’d think of jewelry for your outfit. It is the dazzling, eye-catching decoration. The conversation starter. That is certainly the approach I’ve been taking for my house. In each and every room, I’ve tried to select the lighting to serve as the standout piece. The lighting is the wow factor.\r\n\r\nBut this is no easy task. There are in fact many utilitarian details, such as scale and placement, that do need consideration and (as I’ve learned from trial and error!) professional expertise. Thankfully, I found Capitol Lighting | 1-800-Lighting.com to help me add the perfect finishing touches to our house. Case in point, my bathroom sconce above. I searched high and low to fine the perfect piece for our guest bath. I wanted a light fixture that would balance the space, and compliment the my vibe and feel unique. I spent hours trying to find the perfect option.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I’ve appreciated Capitol Lighting | 1-800-Lighting.com‘s expertise. This isn’t just a warehouse experience of buying lights off a (virtual) shelf. Amazingly,Capitol Lighting | 1-800-Lighting.com allows you to chat online or by phone with one of their highly trained lighting experts who will help you determine fixtures that are the right style and size for your space.\r\n\r\nNot being a trained interior designer, I’ve always struggled with scale (just ask my husband about the number of times we’ve need to reorder something because the size was wrong – eek!).  We enjoy the blessing and the curse of having 11′ foot ceilings in our house. Love them for the drama, hate them for how hard lighting placement becomes.\r\n\r\nWhen we were under construction, we had to create our lighting plan and have light boxes installed (all while I was six weeks postpartum) long before any rooms even had walls. That made it extremely difficult for me to figure out if lights were going to look right in the end. As it turns out, the placement in our guest bath was set very very high. I felt super stuck trying to figure out what could work to pull together the space between our round mirror (which I’m obsessed with) and the light box. Thankfully,Capitol Lighting | 1-800-Lighting.com‘s helped me find the perfect sconce, saving me from ripping out drywall and doing things all over again. My pick, the Aerin Swing Wall Light perfectly connects the distance between the fixture and my mirror. Now  I can finally call my guest bath complete.

It’s particularly interesting given that this penthouse is in Miami. But there’s not obvious kitsch or beachyness to be found. Only timeless style.

It’s design like this that reminds me of the magic of negative space.

If there’s thing you should always invest in, it’s your bed. For our guest room, we went with the Wyatt bed from Room & Board in a soft gray velvet. It has a hotel bed look, which I love. And our Cocoon by Sealy mattress is already getting rave reviews. But it’s how you make your bed that will make visitors feel extra special. I’ve been a bit obsessed with the various bed making styles.

I like just two decorative pillows for a crisp clean look.\r\n\r\nSince we don’t have much furniture yet, I had to get creative to make the guest room functional. No bedside tables? No matter!

Some sacrifices were made, but none that the clients weren’t willing to make. Let’s begin with the living space. Instead of a traditional living room, this space doubles as the parent’s bedroom as well. The bed serves as a couch during the day where the family can lounge about together. They can also make use of the seating around the dining area. The television can conveniently be seen from both these areas. The kitchen is small and functional thanks to its efficient design. To avoid clutter, a storage unit that runs along the length of the apartment has been installed to house all accessories and belongings that are not of immediate use. At the back of the apartment lies a bedroom shared by the two children. Back in the living space, the designers incorporated a bold sculptural Corian wall above the “couch/bed”.

In fact, it is connected to the age of machination and is often referred to of that of the 1920s to 1950s. Contemporary, on the other hand, is not born out of a certain era. It changes as time evolves, and can incorporate modern elements. For example, in a few more decades, a new style will be called contemporary because it is what is in style.\r\n\r\nModern style furnishings and decor celebrate natural materials, neutral or earthy colors and the elimination of unnecessary detailing. While you may see a range of colors in contemporary styling, modern styles would have monochromatic colors--think white-washed rooms, for instance.\r\n\r\nOne of the key beliefs behind the modern design movement is the idea that “form follows function.” In other words, the design of all furnishings and decorative objects should reflect its intended purpose, and if a furnishing, decor or decorating detail does not have a practical purpose then it can be eliminated.\r\n\r\nContemporary furnishings have more distinctive forms and often can include curved furnishings.\r\n\r\nThis philosophy behind the modern style makes it a perfect decorating choice for those who like simple, uncluttered spaces with clean lines and a lack of fussy adornments. \r\n\r\nThe battle to define modern style will probably continue, as it is widely debated if you do a little research online. But at its root, modern style reflects a certain era. That said, many people incorporate pieces of modern style into their homes and offices because of its simple, functional nature. As many people strive for simplicity in life—and there\'s an emphasis on decluttering—perhaps they will be drawn to the modern style because it does seem to simplify everything. That goes along with the design trend of open-concept spaces.','2018-03-16 12:07:59','Modern Style Decor',4,'Understanding--Modern--Style-Decor',4),(38,'THE FALL EDIT','Now that we’re coming up on mid-October, I’ve dropped all things summer like a hot potato and have fully embraced the new season. Except pumpkins. I’m still refusing all pumpkin related items – but I know I’m in the minority on that one. However, I am loving a mix of warm woods, creamy whites, black accents and a touch of metallic or two.','2018-03-16 12:24:59','THE FALL EDIT',1,'THE-FALL-EDIT',5),(39,' A BRIGHT WHITE WORKSPACE TO INSPIRE YOUR WEEK','When Mondays come barreling in all frantic and intense, wouldn’t it be nice to retreat to a brilliant all-white office? There’s something about a clean slate – both figuratively and quite literally – that can help organize your thoughts. This bright white workspace is the physical manifestation of a fresh start.\r\n\r\nThe pops of warm camel brown (all the way down to the camera strap) keep the room from feeling clinical. Hits of black scattered here and there (from the chair legs, to the tea pot and desk lamp) feel modern and cool. And the Serge Mouille wall sconce is perfect. No matter where you put one, they always are. The greenery softens everything with a few organic lines. But this feels like a space where you can breathe. And think. It’s certainly everything I need to clear my mind and get down to business.\r\n','2018-03-16 12:27:00','WORKSPACE TO INSPIRE YOUR WEEK',1,'-A-BRIGHT-WHITE-WORKSPACE-TO-INSPIRE-YOUR-WEEK',10),(40,'GETTING IN THE MOOD THE OLD FASHIONED WAY','We’re taking a poll. Who used to cut their favorite pages out of magazines and tack them onto their walls?? Guilty as charged. Oh how many Teen Beats I destroyed! Thankfully I moved onto Lucky, Domino and Elle Decor. Even just a couple of years ago I was still saving boxes of my favorite tears. But now we’ve all become wholly subsumed by Pinterest and the digital versions of our favorite glossies. It seems the old school moodboard has fallen by the way side and that makes me sad. There’s something so important that comes from the physical act of compiling your inspirations, moving them around until it suddenly just fits!\r\n\r\nWhile we still pull objects, fabric swatches and yes, occasionally tear from a magazine, now we print out our favorite inspirations! You remember those things- printers? If you’re a visual person, we highly recommend adding one to your home office. We’ve been putting our Canon Pixma Pro to serious good use. The photo quality images it prints out – even of our pins – is just jaw dropping. There’s something so satisfying about getting things off of a screen and into your hands. That way you can mix, match, tack and tape to your heart’s content! You’ll be amazed at what new life images take on when actually on paper!\r\n\r\nAfter we’ve amassed a good stack of prints comes the fun part: bringing everything together. If your brain hasn’t already done so, it definitely will start to detect patterns as you begin taking things from the printer and putting them up on you cork board, wall or office door. We have a wire grid from the hardware store {you could use chicken wire for a similar look!} that we spray painted white- it’s our favorite place to clip our printed images and it only cost about $7 to make!\r\n','2018-03-16 12:30:00','THE OLD FASHIONED MOOD',1,'GETTING-IN-THE-MOOD-THE-OLD-FASHIONED-WAY',11),(67,' IDEA TO STEAL: FUZZY WUZZY SEATS','You know the first time you see something unusual and you think oh no, that’s a crazy idea. And then you see it a little bit more and little bit more and it grows on you. That certainly happened with me and mom jeans (I’m praying it won’t happen with the skinny sunglasses thing). But it has also happened with the fuzzy chair trend. Have you seen these guys yet? I’m super curious what you think about them.\r\n\r\nI’m talking about the teddy bear-esque easy chairs that have been showing up all over my Pinterest and in virtually every design magazine you pick up of late. Covered in wooly sheepskin and usually curved like a cozy little nest, turns out this idea is not new. Of course, it is in fact mid-century modern.\r\n\r\nThe most recognized fuzzy chair, called the Tired Man, was created by Danish furniture designer Flemming Lassen in the 1950s.  But the Tired Man chair is actually being produced again today (which is good since vintage ones on 1stdibs are running about $24,000). But the new ones come with hefty pricetags too.','2018-04-04 14:54:38','FUZZY WUZZY SEATS',10,'-IDEA-TO-STEAL--FUZZY-WUZZY-SEATS',1);
